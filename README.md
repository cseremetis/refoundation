# Ridgewood_Ed_Foundation

Public demo website for Ridgewood Education Foundation

## Goal:

Create an application that administrators can update without
having explicit access to source code.

* Administrators can login at <http://refoundation.herokuapp.com/login>

* Administrators can add other administrators (but not remove them)

* Administrators can access, delete, and update web content remotely through the Administrator ("Wizard") portal

## To Run:

This web application runs on Ruby on Rails. To download rails, run <tt>gem install rails</tt>. To run and test locally, run <tt>rails server</tt>. For more details on Rails, see <http://rubyonrails.org>

## Test:

For unit tests, see <tt>/test/models/</tt>. Feel free to add
tests that are missing or incomplete
